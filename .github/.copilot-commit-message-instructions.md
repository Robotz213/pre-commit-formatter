Use conventional commit message format.

Includes task id, type of change, and a brief description of the changes.

The task ID can be found in previous commits, at the beginning of your message (something like "[RHP-103]" or similar). Always include this at the beginning of your message.

Separando por linhas, procure sempre detalhar o que foi feito

Separating by lines, if there are multiple types of change (e.g. 3 files were refacted, 2 were just documentation), always try to detail what was done in each file, grouping them by type of change (e.g.: `'Chore' \n index.html: added js module`), informing the name of the file in the first line along with the type of change (chore, refact, etc.)
