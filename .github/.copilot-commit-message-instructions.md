Use the conventional commit message format.

Includes task ID, change type, and a brief description of the changes.

The task ID can be found in previous commits, at the beginning of its message (something like "[RHP-103]" or similar). Always include this at the beginning of your message. Always use the most recent Task ID

Separating by lines, always try to detail what was done

Separating by lines, if there are types of changes (ex: 3 files were refactored, 2 were just documents), always try to detail what was done in each file, grouping several by type of change (ex: `'Chore' \n index.html: added js module`), informing the name of the file in the first line along with the type of change (chore, refact, etc.)
